            <h2>Getting Ready For A Great Ride</h2>
                <p>How do you feel about spending hours on end in the great outdoors? Do you spend a fair amount of time biking for exercise? Is your idea of a good date an extended hiking trip up into the hills or mountains? Mountain Biking may be just the thing for you.
                    <br/><br/>Even if the idea of spending a long weekend on a nature trail with nothing but a bag of supplies and a rugged bike doesn’t grab you immediately, there’s something uplifting and unique about spending a few hours on a bike trail off of the beaten path, so to speak.
                    <br/><br/>Before you pass judgment on just how exciting an extended outing might be, you’ll want to hop into a quick refresher course on what you need to know about your first MTB holiday and how you can best prepare for the fun and hardships to come.
